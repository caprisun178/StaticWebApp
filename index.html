                <h5>Captured 05/31/2025 at Carolina State Beach Park, NC.</h5>
                <p>The Brown Pelican is a comically elegant bird with an oversized bill, 
                    sinuous neck, and big, dark body. Squadrons glide above the surf along southern and western coasts, rising and falling in a graceful 
                    echo of the waves. They feed by plunge-diving from high up, using the force of impact to stun small fish before scooping them up. 
                    They are fairly common today—an excellent example of a species’ recovery from pesticide pollution that once placed them at the brink of extinction.</p>

                <h3>Cliff Swallow</h3>
                <h5>Captured on 05/14/2025 in Lewisville, NC. </h5>
                <p>Busy flocks of Cliff Swallows often swarm around bridges and overpasses in summer, 
                    offering passers-by a chance to admire avian architecture and family life at once. Clusters of their intricate mud nests cling 
                    to vertical walls, and when a Cliff Swallow is home you can see its bright forehead glowing from the dim entrance. These common, 
                    sociable swallows are nearly always found in large groups, whether they’re chasing insects high above the ground, preening on perches,
                     or dipping into a river for a bath.</p>

                <h3>Red-Tailed Hawk</h3>
                <h5>Captured 08/31/2025 Kernersville, NC</h5>
                <p>This is probably the most common hawk in North America. If you’ve got sharp eyes you’ll see several individuals on almost any long car ride, anywhere. 
                    Red-tailed Hawks soar above open fields, slowly turning circles on their broad, rounded wings. Other times you’ll see them atop telephone poles, eyes 
                    fixed on the ground to catch the movements of a vole or a rabbit, or simply waiting out cold weather before climbing a thermal updraft into the sky.</p>

                <h3>Ruby-Throated hummingbird</h3>
                <h5>Captured 08/28/2025 in East Bend, NC</h5>
                <p>A flash of green and red, the Ruby-throated Hummingbird is eastern North America’s sole breeding hummingbird. These brilliant, tiny, precision-flying
                     creatures glitter like jewels in the full sun, then vanish with a zip toward the next nectar source. Feeders and flower gardens are great ways to attract
                      these birds, and some people turn their yards into buzzing clouds of hummingbirds each summer. Enjoy them while they’re around; by early fall they’re bound
                       for Central America.</p>

                <h3>Osprey</h3>
                <h5>Captured 06/26/2025 in Bayville, NJ</h5>
                <p>Unique among North American raptors for its diet of live fish and ability to dive into water to catch them, Ospreys are common sights soaring over shorelines,
                     patrolling waterways, and standing on their huge stick nests, white heads gleaming. These large, rangy hawks do well around humans and have rebounded in numbers 
                     following the ban on the pesticide DDT. Hunting Ospreys are a picture of concentration, diving with feet outstretched and yellow eyes sighting straight along their talons.</p>
